    "- Duplicated rows can skew our analysis, so we use the `.duplicated().sum()` function to count the number of duplicate rows in our datasets.\n",

    "- If missing values are found, we need to decide whether to fill them with appropriate values or to drop the rows or columns containing them, depending on the extent and nature of the missing data.\n",
    "- In the case of duplicates, after confirming that they are indeed unintended repetitions and not just similar entries, we can remove them using the `.drop_duplicates()` method to maintain the uniqueness of each record."
